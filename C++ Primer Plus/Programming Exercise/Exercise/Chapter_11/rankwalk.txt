Target Distance: 50, Step Size: 20
0: (x,y) = (0, 0)
1: (x,y) = (15.5429, 12.5864)
2: (x,y) = (3.47296, 19.6962)
3: (x,y) = (-6.8404, 18.7939)
After 3 steps, the subject has the following location:
(x,y) = (12.1755, 51.0764)
 or
(m,a) = (52.5075, 76.5922)
Average outward distance per step = 17.5025
